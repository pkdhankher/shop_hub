    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>Shop Hub ("we", "our", or "us") is a shopping aggregator application that provides users with a convenient way to
        explore and access third-party shopping websites using in-app WebViews. We are committed to protecting your
        privacy and maintaining transparency about how our app functions.</p>

    <h2>1. No Personal Data Collection</h2>
    <p>Shop Hub does <strong>not collect, store, or process</strong> any personal user data directly. The app does not
        require you to register or sign in. We do not request or access your personal identity, contacts, messages, or
        financial information.</p>

    <h2>2. Use of WebView</h2>
    <p>Our app primarily uses WebView components to load and display external shopping websites such as Amazon,
        Flipkart, Ajio, etc. These third-party websites may collect personal information, cookies, or usage data as per
        their individual privacy policies. We do not have access to or control over the data collected by these
        third-party sites.</p>

    <h2>3. Permissions</h2>
    <p>The app may request limited permissions such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>INTERNET:</strong> Required to access and display shopping websites via WebView.</li>
        <li><strong>NOTIFICATIONS (optional):</strong> If you choose to enable notifications, they are only used to
            notify you about app updates or offers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>No other permissions (such as camera, microphone, storage) are actively used or required for the appâ€™s core
        functionality. If present in the app manifest, they are legacy declarations and not in active use.</p>

    <h2>4. Analytics & Crash Reporting</h2>
    <p>We may use Google Firebase (or similar tools) to collect anonymous data such as crash reports and usage analytics
        to help improve the app. This data does not contain personally identifiable information and is only used
        internally for app performance optimization.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Deletion Request</h2>
    <p>As we do not collect or store any user data directly, there is no personal data stored on our servers. However,
        if you have any concerns or believe your information was shared unintentionally, you may reach out to us for
        clarification or deletion requests at:</p>
    <p>Email: <a href="mailto:assist.shophub@gmail.com">assist.shophub@gmail.com</a></p>

    <h2>6. Third-party Links</h2>
    <p>Shop Hub contains links to third-party websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of
        these external sites. Please review their respective privacy policies before interacting with them.</p>

    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our app is not directed to children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect any personal data from
        children. If you believe a child has provided personal information, please contact us and we will promptly
        delete the data.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with a revised
        effective date. Continued use of the app indicates acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
